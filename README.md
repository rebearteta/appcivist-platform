# The AppCivist Project 

**AppCivist** is a software platform for democratic assembly and collective action that lets users design and build their own Assemblies, with modular components, to organize democratic action. The project  is a collaboration between the [Social Apps Lab @ CITRIS](http://citris-uc.org/initiatives/social-apps-lab/) at the University of California, Berkeley and [Inria@Silicon Valley](https://project.inria.fr/siliconvalley/). 

## AppCivist Core Platform
